1. ### Tell me about yourself

   "Tell me about yourself" is one of the most common and important interview questions. However, it can be daunting, as it's one you need to get right. After all, not only is it your first 
   impression on the interviewer, but 
   you also need to be simultaneously professional and authentic when answering it.

  So how can you give a good answer without oversharing? To help you structure your answer, we'll give you a rough guideline: start with a short introduction, talk about the present, recount 
  the past, and mention your future goals.

   **Introduction**


  To break the ice, give the interviewers some information about yourself. Here are some questions you can consider answering to get the conversation flowing:

  - How did you get into coding?
  - How have others described you?
  - What are some of your hobbies?
  - What are some side projects you're currently working on?
  
   **Current Experience**
